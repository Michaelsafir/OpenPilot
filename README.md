# Russia Pilot

---

Open Pilot is AI based platform to control car programmatically 


---

*To start platform look in trackerOS.py - here are train engine to collect all data from incoming video frames. It was based on SCAM - to create 3D model. Still in work.*

*By this model you can detect lines with OpenCV functions. Also you can write your own 3D model based on this code.*

## This is not ready product 

*Only prepare to implement AI base to detect road, cars and other options. Also in plan - add LIDAR to understand positions of cars*
